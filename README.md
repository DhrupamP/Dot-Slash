# AgroMate
This project is made under **DotSlash 5.0** which is a mobile application made using Flutter to help 
farmers keep track of their crops with respect to different weather conditions and different 
diseases which can harm their crops.

We have used Open Weather Map API to get the weather data using the device's geolocation, Google 
Collab for training the ML model for identifying the crop from the image of its leaves. We have 
also added file storing functionality where a user can login/ register and then any documents from
phone storage can be uploaded to Firebase. Lastly, we have added a news section where we can 
get all the latest news related to agriculture.
